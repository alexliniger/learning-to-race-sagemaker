# learning-to-race DLAD Exercise
Base script for a RL exercise of the Deep Learning for Autonomous Driving (DLAD) lecture.
The script allows includes the base functionality to train a RL agent with Stable Baselines and logging scripts using WandB.

The exercise involves studying the different continuous input RL algorithms for autonomous racing, and how the generalize to harder realistic setups. 

The script is setup to use AWS Sagemaker for training in the cloud.
